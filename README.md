UC Discovery Service
====================

Middleman project to build simple shibboleth "discovery service"
for UC campuses

# How would I use this?

This is for use with [shibboleth](https://shibboleth.net) a single
sign on software used by the [InCommon](http://www.incommon.org) identity federation
that the University of California participates in.

# Building

 * Install http://bower.io for web dev package magic
   * requires https://npmjs.org and http://nodejs.org
   * `npm install -g bower`

 * Install http://bundler.io for ruby package magic
   * requires http://rubygems.org and https://www.ruby-lang.org/
   * `gem install bundler`

```
bower install                  # install all web libraries required
bundle                         # install middle man / ruby asset pipline
bundle exec middleman          # test server for middleman
bundle exec middleman build    # build static templates
```

# Install
Serve `./build/` from the path `/ds/` on your apache/mod_shib server.

# Customize
If you are a Shibboleth SP and your application is just available to the 
campuses and UCOP, then you can customize help email address:
```
HELP_EMAIL='my_email@example.com' bundle exec middleman build
```
or 
```
./change_email my_email@example.com
```
will just hack the email with `sed` (no need for `node` and `ruby`).

If you want to customize more than the email, you can edit the templates in `source`.  

In the HTML source use `data-entityid` to specify the IdP entityID.
```html
<a data-entityid="urn:mace:incommon:berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a>
```

The Shibboleth SP software, as part of the user login flow, will redirect the user
to `/ds/?entityID=...&return=...`.  `return` is a URL.  Javascript is used to turn
`data-entityID` attributes into the proper hrefs to continue in the login workflow
once a campus is selected.

```html
<a href="{return}&entityID={data-entityid}">UC Berkeley</a></div>
```

Simply edit the HTML to use the entityIDs for your IdPs you wish to use.
